We met Monday (9/20) in order to work on the button together. 
#Learned today
We learned how to edit the demo files for better tests. Our only work had previously been in the src.
#Next steps
Next we will try to fix our naming convenion issues. The underscore was a typo that has created many problems. I would also like to try to edit the style of the button to looka little more like the one we based it off of.
