<h1>Team Notes</h1>
We met Monday (9/20) in order to work on the button together. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Learned today (9/21)</b>
<br>
We learned how to edit the demo files for better tests. Our only work had previously been in the src.
<br>
<br>
<b>Next steps</b>
<br>
Next we will try to fix our naming convenion issues. The underscore was a typo that has created many problems. I would also like to try to edit the style of the button to look a little more like the one we based it off of.
<br>
<br>
<b>Work (9/23)</b>
<br>
Today, we worked on adding an icon to our button. Hannah followed along with the demo and updated the repo with icon functionality. Taylor worked on storybook funcitonality and adding the necessary files for that.
