<h1>Team Notes</h1>
We met Monday (9/20) in order to work on the button together and come up with ideas for execution. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Learned today (9/21)</b>
<br>
We learned how to edit the demo files for better tests. Our only work had previously been in the src.
<br>
<br>
<b>Next steps</b>
<br>
Next we will try to fix our naming convenion issues. The underscore was a typo that has created many problems. We hope to resovle this issue(s) timely. We would also like to try to edit the style of the button to look a little more like the one we based it off of.
<br>
<br>
<b>Work (9/23)</b>
<br>
Today, we worked on adding an icon to our button. Hannah followed along with the demo and updated the repo with icon functionality. Taylor worked on storybook funcitonality and adding the necessary files for that. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Weekend Work (9/25 - 9/26)</b>
<br>
This weekend, we worked on the styling of the button to make it look like the website that we based it off of. We are very happy and satisfied on the way that it turned out and can't wait to more forward from this point into the final steps.
