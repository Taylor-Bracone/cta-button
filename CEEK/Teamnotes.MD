Met online 9/20 to share our progress and figure out how to make some of these functions work together.

What We've learned:
Scope is self-contained
Using slots
Making the same button and changing styles and conventions
Style everything using basic hml, reverse engineer to make it what you want (Live demo)

What We Plan To Work On:
Make our button more professional
Add other required functionality
Try incorporating icons
Increase accessability
Support color variations
Try and use different elements from buttons and put them into our own button

Meetings:
Thursdays after class, option to meet on Zoom
